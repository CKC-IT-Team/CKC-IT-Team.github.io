    1. Division heads manage their division in any way they see fit without supervision (one exception noted below) unless rebutted by a full vote. This includes but is not limited to ranking systems, assignments, and awarding (with supervision from upper management).<br>
    2. Crew member induction is, from 10/25/24 on, to be conducted by the jurisdiction of the highest-ranking official of a division (or the person to whom this official has entrusted this responsibility), where this official can only induct members to their own division. These inductions should <b>not</b> be announced prior to induction to avoid corruption through alteration of policy.<br>
    3. Any crew member reserves the right to show themselves off-duty.
